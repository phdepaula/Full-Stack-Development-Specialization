## üè™ Sales and Invoice Management System

This system plays a crucial role in supporting the operations of an online store, encompassing the entire sales cycle, from detailed internal product registration to the completion of the sale and the issuance of invoices. It consists of three distinct microservices:

* **[Online Store](https://github.com/phdepaula/Online-Store-Microservice):** This microservice is responsible for the registration, updating, and deletion of product-related information, as well as sales records. It serves as the core of the online store, managing all operations related to the product catalog and sales history.

* **[Order Management](https://github.com/phdepaula/Order-Management-Microservice):** Responsible for accessing sales records stored in the Online Store microservice and enriching them with address information, if not provided. This is accomplished through integration with an external API called ViaCep, which returns address data based on the provided Brazilian postal code (CEP). Additionally, Order Management monitors and controls sales that require the generation of invoices.

* **[Invoice Generator](https://github.com/phdepaula/Invoice-Generator-Microservice):** This microservice accesses invoice requests generated by the Order Management microservice and produces sales invoices in XML format. It also provides information on whether the invoices were approved or rejected, ensuring proper management of fiscal documentation.

> Together, these three microservices make up a comprehensive solution for sales and invoice management, providing an efficient and reliable experience for the online store and its customers.
